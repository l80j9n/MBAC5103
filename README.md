GROW YOUR OWN 
On December   1, Year   1, Jack and Diane Jones formed a social   enterprise   Grow Your Own. The social enterprise will meet the community need of   providing   a   community garden.

The new social enterprise was able to begin operations immediately by purchasing the assets and taking over the location of Cabot Trail Rentals, an equipment rental company that was going out of   business.
